# Hey There, Im Neo!
I'm a coding enthusiast who's still trying to figure out if coding is actually my thing or if I just like the idea of being a tech-savvy wizard. I mean, let's be real, typing away at a computer screen for hours on end isn't exactly the glamorous life I thought it would be. But there's something oddly satisfying about getting code to work after countless hours of troubleshooting, and I'm not quite sure if that makes me a genius or a masochist. Either way, I'm in too deep now to turn back.

## What I do
Well, let's just say that I'm a 16-year-old who thinks he's the next Bill Gates, but in reality, I'm just trying to impress my friends with the "Active Developer" badge on Discord. But hey, who needs actual talent when you have the power of Google and Stack Overflow at your fingertips?

## My Skills
Oh, you want to know what I do best? Buckle up, because this is going to be quite the list.   

• Googling like a pro (I have a black belt in Google-fu).  
• My sense of humor (The only thing stopping me from throwing my pc out my window when my code inevitably breaks).  
• Web development (Making the internet a prettier place, one line at a time (Or one google at a time)).  
• Problem Solving (Or as I like to call it: "Creative Procrastination").  
• Stack Overflow Whisperer (I can find the perfect answer even in the darkest depths of unaswered questions).  
• Impressive Error Generation (I can create errors so unique and advanced that even google has never seen them).

## Contact Me
Hold up there, partner! You think you're gonna get my snap just like that? Sorry, but you gotta wine and dine me first. And by wine and dine, I mean offer me some killer coding tips or help me build a sweet Discord bot. Now we're talking! My Discord username is Nͥeͣoͫʸᵒᵘʳ ˢᶦˢᵗᵉʳ#3468, so hit me up if you're ready to get your coding game on.

## Conclusion
While I may not be the most skilled or experienced coder out there (yet), I make up for it in pure enthusiasm and determination. Sure, I may have to Google every other line of code, but that's just part of the fun, right? Who knows, maybe one day I'll be able to code without the crutch of Google (but let's be real, probably not).
